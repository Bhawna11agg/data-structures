  Backtracking is the method of building the solution one piece at a time recursively and incrementally. The method keeps removing all those bits that do not contribute to the solution.
One such real-life example is a maze. At every dead end, you trace back your steps and set out for another path- thus setting a perfect example for backtracking. Similarly, Sudoku works on the same principle.
Thatâ€™s what backtracking is, retracing back the steps and discarding the choice that doesn't add on to build the correct solution.
  
  #### Examples of Back-Tracking: (Coding along the explanation)
   - [Shortest path in maze, and Partitioning an array using backtracking in recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3rnLLHl0PM&list=PLKKfKV1b9e8pWy_UIiJlOlX_T4al_UtQJ&index=5) (Video)
   - [Visualization of Rat-in-maze problem and its approach through backtracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxGTHraMNg) (Video)
   - [Visualization of N-Queens problem and its approach through backtracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DeznFqrgAI) (Video)
   
   We will code more question in sessions, like Rat-in-maze, Subarray-sum-to-given-value, etc (as they are difficult to understand through video, so complete the above examples before the session, and have basic idea of Backtracking in recursion).
