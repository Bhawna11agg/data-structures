  ### 1. [Introduction to Divide and Conquer (DAC)](https://www.javatpoint.com/divide-and-conquer-introduction) (Blog: 15mins read)

  #### Examples of DAC: (Coding along with explanation)
   - [Fibonacci series with recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZweb2ClmQ4) (Video)
   - [Merge Sort ideaology with DAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzeBrDU-JaY) (Video)
   
   We will code more question in sessions, like merge-sort, quick-sort, Closest Pair-of-Points etc (as they are difficult to understand through video, so complete the above examples before the session, and have basic idea of divide and conquer algo).
